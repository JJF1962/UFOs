# UFOs
## Overview 
The objective of the  challenge for Module 11, it was to  create a table to organize UFO data stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and it was created using JavaScript as the primary coding language, and  it was used abd applied HTML and Bootstrap skills. It was learned the some diffrences,strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+. We went deeper in  sintax JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases. Build and deploy  functions, convert  functions to arrow functions, for each (JavaScript for loop)  and finally to create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.
* Tools: JavaScript, HTML, Website developer tool (Google)-Chrome and Vs Code.
* Files: ufo_starterCode.js, app_1.js, index.html, data.js and style.ccs
Our Goal was to improve the website page, allowing the users to filter at the same time information such as city, state, country, shape and dates as show in image below.

## Results
* Deliverable 1 Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria 
Using JavaScript and HTML, it was  modified the code in the index.html file to create more table filters. Aditionally  to the date filter, it was  added filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:

It was used extensively during the code process the filter variable and the following functions: updateFilters(), handleClick(), filterTable(), d3.select(this), ForEach(), if Else, list-group-item class, label, and input tags to add filtered data yo an index.html file, and finally customize the page with CSS.

* Delivery 2 A written report on the UFO analysis
This docyments was added to explain the objective, results and summary.

## Summary & Conclusion
* JavaScript is a very versatile tool, that allow interact in an efficient way with websites using VSCode
* The data sample was small, with limitation to retrive historical data.
* It is recommendable a further study to evaluate if from other websites it will be posibile to increase the volume of reliable data.
* It was very challenging and fun.
